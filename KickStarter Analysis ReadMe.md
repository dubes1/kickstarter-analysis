# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose  
Find the correlation between launch dates and goals for plays launched on kickstarter

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date  
The best month to launch a kickstarter would be May with the highest ratio of successful to unsuccessful kickstarters and the worst month would be December with the lowest ratio

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals  
The lower the goal the higher the chance of success (*there is much less data available with higher goal kickstarters making it look like there is a good chance for success but there is insufficient data to support that thesis*)

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered  
for outcomes based on goals the chart made it look like some much higher goals are attainable because it was made only with a percentage successful for kickstarters but in reality there very little kickstarters with such a high goal

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?  
__Theaters launched in May have the highest success rate.__  
__December has the least amount of successful launches__
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?  
__The lower the outcome the better chance of success (higher outcomes don't have enough kickstarters to gain any real sense of a success rate but on the lower end there is enough information to say that the lower the goal the greater the chance of success)__

- What are some limitations of this dataset?  
__There is mixed currency so dollars do not match up__  
__We don't have demographic information for kickstarter funders__

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?  
__Outcome vs Avg Backers__  
__Outcome vs Avg Donation Size__
